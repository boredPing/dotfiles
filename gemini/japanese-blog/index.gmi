Hello there, fellow ~~weebs~~ programmers. I have decided to learn Japanese, so I will use this site as my personal blog and journal.

## Why?
I have always been surounded by Japanese culture: be it karate, anime, shows etc.
It simply sparked my curiosity.

## Is there an **actual** reason?
Besides watching anime without subtitles and visiting Japan? Not really, no.

## What do I use?
This guide, which also features a grammar guide + kana practicing:
=> https://gohoneko.neocities.org/learn/learnmain

### Kana
* The previosly mentioned site
* Duolingo
